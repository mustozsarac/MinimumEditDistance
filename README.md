First one: I implemented a MED algorithm with a user interface, which takes input as a ‘word’ and lists its first 5 alternative correct words (list nearest 5 words) by using the dictionary given. Which is "sozluk.txt".  

Second one: For given two words, find the MED value of transforming from first word to second, show the steps in a table and write the operations’ names needed to transform.
